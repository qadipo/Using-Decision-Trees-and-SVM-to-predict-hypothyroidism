# Using-Decision-Trees-and-SVM-to-predict-hypothyroidism

## Introduction
A hospital wishes to conduct a medical bootcamp focusing on hypothyroidism. In order to speed up diagnosis time, the hospital wishes to build a model that will use observed symptoms to make determine whether one has hypothyroidism or not.

In order to build the model the following two machine learning algorithms will be considered:
1. **Decision Trees:** Here Random Forest, AdaBoosted trees and Gradient Boosted trees shall be considered with best optimization prectices employed. The best model shall then be identified and the most impactful features that influence the decision.
2. **Support Vector Machine:** Here polynomial, linear and rbf kernel functions will be employed to build the model. Their performances shall then be evaluated and the best model selected. Further, parameter tuning shall also be performed to improve the model further.
